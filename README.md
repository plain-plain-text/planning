# Plain Plain Text (Planning)

Plain Plain Text is an initiative by Research Data Services at Columbia
University Libraries and the Experimental Methods Group (xpMethod) at Columbia
University.

**Mission:** Facilitating and propagating the use of minimal computing and
plain text methods and/or standards in the acquisition, analysis, management,
and dissemination of scholarly knowledge.

More concretely, we aim to have answers when people ask the following
questions:

* I want to create an online image archive
* I want to write a handsome research paper
* I want to create a modular CV that is both online and a pdf
* I want to create a personal home page
* I want to manage my data in way that follows FAIR conventions
* I want to edit and distribute an academic journal
